Interactive advertising has emerged as a highly effective approach, captivating viewers and driving brand awareness with greater efficacy than static advertising. The Elaboration Likelihood Model, put forth by Petty and Cacioppo in 1986, unveils the intricate psychological processes at play. It elucidates that individuals process information through either central or peripheral processing. By offering ample opportunities for interaction and engagement, interactive ads hold the potential to stimulate central processing, thereby fostering profound message elaboration and cultivating a more favorable brand attitude.

Augmenting the Elaboration Likelihood Model, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) offers valuable insights into the factors influencing consumer behavior, including the effectiveness of interactive ads. The TPB delineates three key elements: intention, perceived behavioral control, and attitude. Interactive ads can impact all these factors, rendering them more effective than their non-interactive counterparts. By incorporating interactive elements, these ads can heighten the intention to engage in a desired behavior by rendering it more captivating and appealing. Moreover, they can enhance perceived behavioral control by instilling a sense of ease and accessibility in performing the behavior. Furthermore, interactive ads have the potential to shape attitudes toward the behavior, making it more desirable and evoking positive evaluations. This alignment with the principles of the TPB underscores the efficacy of interactive advertising in fostering user engagement and driving behavior.

The Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) provides an additional lens through which to understand the effectiveness of interactive ads, underscoring the role of observational learning. As posited by the SCT, individuals acquire knowledge by observing others and their behaviors. In the context of interactive ads, this theory suggests that such ads can serve as models for desired behavior. For instance, an interactive ad featuring an individual delightfully driving a new car can serve as a compelling model, igniting a desire and motivation in consumers to experience the same joy. By offering this visual representation and showcasing the positive outcomes associated with the behavior, interactive ads possess the power to inspire consumers to seek similar experiences. This alignment with the tenets of the SCT further solidifies the notion that interactive ads hold greater sway in influencing consumer behavior compared to non-interactive ads.

Building upon the foundation laid by the Elaboration Likelihood Model, the Interactivity Theory, conceived by Liu and Shrum in 2002, delves deeper into the role of interactivity in advertising. This theory posits that interactivity engenders a heightened sense of control, involvement, and engagement among viewers. By actively involving viewers in the advertising experience, interactive ads captivate their attention and foster deeper engagement, transcending the passive nature of static ads. The capacity for viewers to actively participate in the advertisement and shape their own experiences adds an interactive dimension that heightens overall engagement and attentiveness.

Furthermore, the Social Presence Theory, initially formulated by Short, Williams, and Christie in 1976, sheds light on the impact of social interaction in advertising. This theory contends that individuals experience an enhanced sense of social presence when they perceive themselves as interacting with others. Interactive ads that incorporate features facilitating social interaction, such as commenting or sharing, amplify this sense of social presence, thereby fostering greater engagement and involvement among viewers.

Supporting these theoretical perspectives, the study conducted by Natalia Viktorovna Antonova in 2015 titled "The Psychological Effectiveness of Interactive Advertising" provides empirical evidence that interactivity empowers individuals, enabling them to identify with advertising characters and actively participate within the advertising environment. This active involvement engenders a willingness to act in the real world, amplifying the potential impact of interactive advertising on consumer behavior and brand perception.

In conclusion, the Elaboration Likelihood Model, Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), Interactivity Theory, and Social Presence Theory collectively illuminate the effectiveness of interactive advertising in fostering engagement and brand awareness. This literature review, bolstered by empirical evidence, underscores that interactive ads surpass static ads in their psychological impact on individuals and their ability to effectively convey brand messages. By fostering central processing, interactivity, social interaction, intention, perceived behavioral control, attitude, and observational learning, interactive ads shape consumer behavior and drive greater brand engagement. As interactive advertising continues to evolve and captivate audiences, its importance as a powerful marketing tool becomes increasingly evident.
